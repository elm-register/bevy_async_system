# Version Rule

This rule applies from afters v0.3.4.

Basically, the version will be updated according to the terms of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
but the following points are different.

- before v1.0.0: If breaking change occurs, increment the MINOR version number.
- after v1.0.0: If breaking change occurs, increment the MAJOR version number.
